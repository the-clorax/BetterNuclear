insidious-actinite=extremely dangerous mixed actinites. but for some reason touching it isn't turning you into a pile of carbon. could fry any circuit it gets close to.
neptunium-237=fairly radioactive. you can hold it in your hand for a little bit without getting burned.
plutonium-239=fairly radioactive, very fissile. if you carry to much in the same space it will get very hot very fast
plutonium-238=very radioactive, easily contained. good fuel for radioisotope generators
spent-MOX-fuel-cell=very radioactive mix of noxious metals.
MOX-fuel-cell=Gives much more energy than uranium cell, reusing a valuable faction of nuclear waste.
depleted-uranium=stable enough to make armor out of if you ignore the fact that it's toxic like arsenic.

advanced-nuclear-waste-processing=more environmentally friendly, but more complicated way of factioning the byproducts
depleted-uranium-armor=heavy armor that slows you down and gives no inventory size bonus, but is extremely rugged.
nuclear-fuel-reprocessing=an environmentally unfriendly way to reprocess nuclear fuel. spin it in a centrifuige and dump out the purple stuff.
plutonium-processing-1=this radioisotope is extremely dense with energy. use it in MOX form
plutonium-processing-2=plutonium is very useful, but hard to make through uranium burning. here are alternative methods to aquire it.w
kovarex-enrichment-process=further enrichment of uranium is hard to set up and very expensive but will pay off with earth-shattering power

BetterNuclear=expands the nuclear system to include more efficient, realistic, or useful things. will soon be compatible with angelbobs and IndustrialRevolution. many new isotopes have recipes but are not currently useful. go to the mod portal to see the plans.
